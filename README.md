# jquery-dcc-eastern-adventures-zero-level-generator
A random zero level character generator, designed using JavaScript/JQuery, for the Dungeon Crawl Classics pen and paper game system.  This generator allows for several character generation options, which includes using modifed means of ability score generation, assigning maximum hit points and generating random character names.  External JavaScript files have been created to high cohesion and low coupling for this application; thereby allowing changes, updates and re-use of the application easier to achieve.  Thus, relating to one of the goals of Object Oriented Programming.
